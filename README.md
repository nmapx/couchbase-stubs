# Couchbase PHP SDK development stubs

## Description

It's a stub of Couchbase PHP SDK.

**No system requirements**, pure code.

Recommended for docker environment projects and for those who don't have Couchbase PHP SDK (extension) locally installed.

## Installation guide

Just add this library to your composer.json file (the best way is to add it as require-dev) or download it manually and place somewhere in your project dir. Your IDE should recognize it and... that's it! Don't forget to "lock" your version on a specific release.

### using Composer

composer require --dev nmapx/couchbase-stubs
```
